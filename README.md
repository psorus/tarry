# tarry
a simple implementation of tarrys algorithm for arbitrary object mazes


maze: A construct that needs to be inherited by each maze object
collatz: A maze that tries to find a way to make a number into another one like in the collatz conjecture (either 3n+1,2n,n/2 or (n-1)/3)
genmaze (arrmaze): a classical 2d array maze
tarry(tarry): the implementation of the tarry algorithm (my version of it..)
